                <h2>SEO, what does that mean ?</h2>
                <p class="SEODefinition">Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a set of practices to improve the visibility and accessibility of a website.<br>
                    Search engines (e.g. Google) help to sort out all the information available. They try to show first what people are most likely to like, based on what they have typed (their "query"). To know which sites to show first in a natural way (without using advertising), search engines rely on a lot of criteria (an algorithm). The goal is to keep people on the Internet as long as possible. The user experience is therefore very important! Unlike what most people believe, SEO is not only about keyword research; we don't write for a machine, but for Internet users. If people leave the site quickly, for example because it is not well written, Google will penalize that.<br> 
                    The goal of SEO is therefore to arrive in the first results for a query, because the first 3 links (excluding ads) are the links on which people click the most!

                        <h3>Code</h3>
                        <p>It's really important to create a good code with good tags to help search engines understand the structure of the website. Other important aspects are the responsive design or load speed of the website. It's our job as developers, so let's be careful!</p>

                    <div class="rule">
                        <h3>Content</h3>
                        <p>Webmasters must use keywords that correspond to users' queries. It's also really important to create a good content, with synonyms, semantic fields and without spelling mistakes! (This website is not a good example, my English is not perfect...)</p>

                    <div class=rule>
                        <h3>Links</h3>
                        <p>Links between several pages of the website and links from/to other websites are very important. Be careful, the backlinks (from other websites) can be very good...or not if it comes from bad websites!</p>
